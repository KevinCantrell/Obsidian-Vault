Energy is the currency of the universe.  It is defined as the capacity to do work. It is the means by which all change is achieved.  All forms of energy are related to motion.  Energy cannot be created or destroyed.

We perceive energy changing from one for to another
* potential to kinetic (a dropped object)
* chemical to thermal (a fire)
* electrical to light/sound (a movie)

Energy can move through space via electromagnetic energy (and gravitational energy?)
