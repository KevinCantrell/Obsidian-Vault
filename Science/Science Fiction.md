The Ted Chiang short story that I mentioned is called "Exhalation" and you can [read it here](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/ "https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/") In addition to a neuroscience self-surgery, it is also about the second law of thermodynamics.Â  

I also recommend the movie Arrival ([Rotten Tomatoes link](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/arrival_2016 "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/arrival_2016")) which is based on his novella "Story of Your Life".
